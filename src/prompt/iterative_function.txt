// Provide a fix for the vulnerable function

// Vulnerable Function
{Vulnerable_Function_1}

Let’s think step by step.
Step 1: The vulnerable hunks within vulnerable function are {Vulnerable_Hunk_Locations_1}.
Step 2: The patch hunks that need to be repaired are {GroundTruth_Patch_Hunk_Location_Sequence_1}.
Step 3: Please generate the corresponding patched function.

// Fixed Function
{Patch_Function_1}

// Provide a fix for the vulnerable function

// Vulnerable Function
{Vulnerable_Function_2}

Let’s think step by step.
Step 1: The vulnerable hunks within vulnerable function are {Vulnerable_Hunk_Locations_2}.
Step 2: The patch hunks that need to be repaired are {GroundTruth_Patch_Hunk_Location_Sequence_2}.
Step 3: Please generate the corresponding patched function.

// Patched Function
{Patch_Function_2}

// Provide a fix for the vulnerable function

// Vulnerable Function
{function}

Let's think step by step. The vulnerable line that triggerred the vulnerability is {line} in line {number}.
Step 1 - Let's predict the positions of the statements that need to be modified based on the vulnerable line that triggered the vulnerability. fixing location may not be same as the vulnerable location.
Step 2 - Let's generate the patch function of the provided vulnerable function according to the vulnerable function and the positions that need to be modified in the first step. Please note that only the function is required (Do not omit any unchanged statements in the output patch; it is essential to maintain the integrity of functions.), without the need for header files or other functions and any textual explanations.
